# freeeeg128 — host-side Python stack

Runs on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W companion of the FreeEEG128 beta, or on any
Linux / macOS host for development. The same package reads both the BrainFlow
synthetic board (pre-validation) and the FreeEEG128 USB-CDC stream (once
firmware is ready).

## Why this directory exists

The beta architecture has a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W sharing a shoulder-bag
enclosure with the FreeEEG128 PCB (see `../ENCLOSURE.md` and `../ROADMAP.md`
§B0.1). This directory holds the code that runs on that Pi:

- Synthetic-data benchmarks (before real device is ready).
- Capture client that reads the FreeEEG128 framed USB-CDC stream (once
  `docs/packet-format.md` is locked).
- LSL outlet republishing the stream for MNE Scan, BrainFlow, EEG-ExPy,
  Timeflux, LabRecorder, etc.
- FastAPI web UI for session control and quality monitoring.
- BIDS-EEG / FIFF writers.

## Pi Zero 2W setup

Tested on **Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit Lite, Bookworm** (2026 builds).

### 1. Flash the OS

Use Raspberry Pi Imager (macOS / Windows / Linux):

- Device: `Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W`
- OS: `Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) Lite`
- Storage: 32 GB microSD, Class 10 or better
- Advanced options (gear icon):
  - Enable SSH with password authentication
  - Set hostname: `freeeeg-pi`
  - Set username: `morgan` (or your preferred)
  - Configure Wi-Fi with your SSID + password
  - Set locale

### 2. First boot and install

Boot the Pi, SSH in:

```bash
ssh morgan@freeeeg-pi.local
```

Clone this repo and run the installer:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git
git clone https://github.com/<you>/freeeeg128.git
cd freeeeg128/host
./scripts/install_pi.sh
```

The installer creates a venv at `~/freeeeg`, installs NumPy, SciPy, pylsl,
BrainFlow, MNE-Python, and optionally EEG-ExPy, then runs a quick smoke test.

### 3. Run the benchmark suite

```bash
source ~/freeeeg/bin/activate
cd ~/freeeeg128/host
make bench
```

Results are appended to `results/bench-<hostname>-<date>.csv` so you can
compare across OS choices, Pi models, and (eventually) real-device runs.

## Benchmarks

| Bench | File | What it measures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python / NumPy speed | `bench/bench_python.py` | 128×25 000 complex FFT time, dot product, memory BW proxy |
| LSL loopback | `bench/bench_lsl.py` | Outlet + inlet round-trip latency and throughput for 128-ch float32 at 250 Hz |
| BrainFlow synthetic | `bench/bench_brainflow.py` | `SYNTHETIC_BOARD` streaming at 250 Hz for 60 s; drop count |
| MNE online preprocessing | `bench/bench_mne.py` | Bandpass filter + ICA on 5-min synthetic epoch |
| EEG-ExPy pipeline | `bench/bench_eegexpy.py` | Visual-P300 paradigm runtime with synthetic backend (skipped if `eeg-expy` not installed) |

Each prints one line of JSON per metric to stdout; `make bench` pipes all of
them into one CSV.

## Targets (Pi Zero 2W, Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit, Bookworm-class)

Sanity floor we establish once so we can tell when something regresses
later. **First-run numbers captured 2026-04-19** on Pi Zero 2W (BCM2710
Cortex-A53 quad @ 1 GHz, 512 MB RAM) over iPhone Personal Hotspot.

| Bench | Target | **Pi Zero 2W** | Laptop | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FFT 128×25 000 complex64 | < 2 s | **1522 ms** | ~40 ms | single-thread NumPy+OpenBLAS; Cortex-A53 is ~30× slower than M-series on FP64 |
| Dot 2M float32 | < 20 ms | **8.4 ms** | < 2 ms | memory-BW dominated |
| Log 1M float64 | < 200 ms | **50.5 ms** | < 10 ms | ALU-bound |
| LSL p50 latency (100 ms batch, 128 ch) | < 20 ms | **12.8 ms** | < 2 ms | push+pull over localhost |
| LSL p95 latency | < 20 ms | **12.9 ms** | | |
| LSL max latency | < 50 ms | **14.8 ms** | | earlier 1010 ms was a bench-warmup artefact; fixed in commit f46cd38 |
| LSL sustained throughput | > 500 sps | **1680 sps** | | 6.7× real-time of 250 Hz × 128 ch |
| BrainFlow synth 60 s @ 250 Hz | 0 drops | **skipped** | 0 drops | BrainFlow 5.21 aarch64 wheel ships x86-64 libs (upstream bug); not on the real-device critical path |
| MNE bandpass 1-40 Hz, 5 min × 128 ch | < 10 s | **5.46 s** | < 1 s | FIR firwin |
| MNE ICA 15 components, 5 min × 128 ch | < 30 s | not-yet-measured | | sklearn fastica method available after `pip install scikit-learn` |
| Wall power, 10-min LSL idle loopback | < 2 W | not-yet-measured | | needs USB power meter |
| Wall power, 10-min active capture | < 3 W | not-yet-measured | | needs USB power meter |

The Pi Zero 2W comfortably handles our target workload of 128 ch × 250 Hz
streaming + host-side buffering, with roughly **7.6× real-time margin** on
the LSL path (1907 sps achieved vs 250 sps target). End-to-end
`synth_to_lsl.py` (synthetic → parser → LSL outlet) runs 30 s of 128 ch
× 250 Hz in 13 s wall time with **0 drops** — about 2.3× real-time margin
on the full pipeline.

## End-to-end pipeline without hardware

The full host stack — framed-packet parser, LSL republisher, FIFF
writer, BIDS-EEG writer — runs today on the Pi Zero 2W with synthetic
data.  The only change when real hardware arrives is swapping the
byte source from `SyntheticSource` to `pyserial.Serial` reading the
FreeEEG128's USB-CDC tty.

```bash
# one-shot smoke test
host/scripts/pipeline_smoketest.sh

# or run the stages manually:
./scripts/synth_to_lsl.py --duration 30 --realtime &
./scripts/record_session.py --duration 20 --subject demo
```

Outputs land in `host/out/recordings/`:
- `sub-<id>_ses-<n>_task-<name>_<ts>_raw.fif` — MNE-ready FIFF.
- `bids/` — BIDS-EEG directory tree (participants.tsv, dataset_description.json, sub-*/ses-*/eeg/*.edf, channels.tsv, scans.tsv, README).

Pi-validated performance (4996 / 5000 samples, ~0.08 % drop from poll granularity, on a 20 s record at 250 Hz × 128 ch).

## Running without a Pi

Everything works on a laptop too:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/freeeeg
source ~/freeeeg/bin/activate
pip install -e .
make bench
```

Useful during development — iterate on the Mac, push to the Pi over SSH for
final timing numbers.
